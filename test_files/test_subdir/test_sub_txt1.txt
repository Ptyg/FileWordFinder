Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits 
into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is 
the most reliable feature to define the species' family. 

Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better 
tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, 
which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. 

Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.
