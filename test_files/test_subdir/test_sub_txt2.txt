Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, but are also farmed commercially. 
Their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is 
also considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and Nile crocodiles, 
while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare Siamese crocodile is also bred in Asian farms. 

Farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in Australia, 
as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. 

Crocodile leather can be made into goods such as wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes.
