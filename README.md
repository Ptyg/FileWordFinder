# FileWordFinder

## What is here?

Here is my project which helps to find word in txt files and objects where this word is found in xml files. All you need to do is specify the path to the directory with the files.

## Source of ideas

My problem was that I needed to find a word in a text file and object where the word in it in xml file, but I was too lazy to open each file and search with ctrl+f. So I made this program that allows you to view each file in a directory and show which file the word is in, the file path and line number.

## Functionality

So, to work with this programm you need:
1. Choose file type to work with (txt or xml)
2. Choose working option (with subdirectories or without it)
3. Enter a word

That's all. Working with TXT, we will get a list showing 
- which file the word is in
- the path to it
- on which line 
  
Working with XML we will get other list showing 
- which file the word is in
- the path to it
- object path to the word
- on which line
